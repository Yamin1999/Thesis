# Thesis

Our thesis suggests an improved machine learning framework using a deep convolutional neural network
(CNN). Using five-fold cross-validation, based on 27,578 single-cell images, the common accuracy of our
new 13-layer CNN version is 96.41% which is close to any transfer learning method. we have also shown
that our deep CNN model is simpler and more computationally efficient than the other existing transfer
learning methods.
